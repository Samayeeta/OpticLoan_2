# ⚖️ OpticLoan: Precision Document Auditing

OpticLoan is a state-of-the-art **Forensic Intelligence Platform** designed to protect borrowers by deconstructing complex loan agreements. It utilizes advanced Neural Networks and optimized memory orchestration to identify predatory "trap clauses" hidden in large legal documents.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Forensic Fact Extraction:** Distills 50+ page documents into core financial markers (APR, Penalties, Dates).
- **Trap Auditing:** Identifies escalation clauses, acceleration triggers, and cross-default traps.
- **Explainable AI:** Provides clear legal reasoning for every risk detected.
- **Memory-Optimized Pipeline:** Custom cloud-native orchestration that allows auditing of massive documents without local lag or OOM errors.

## 🧠 The "Memory Breakthrough"
Unlike standard AI apps that struggle with large PDFs, OpticLoan uses:
1. **Isolated Garbage Collection:** Explicit RAM purging after digitization.
2. **2.0M Context Window:** Entire document analysis in a single unified stream.
3. **Cloud-Native Elasticity:** Offloading "thinking" to avoid local memory bottlenecks.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS (Forensic Aesthetic)
- **Backend:** Flask, Python (Memory Managed)
- **ML Engine:** Gemini 2.x Flash Chain (Cloud-Native Forensic Engine)
- **OCR/Parsing:** PyMuPDF (Optimized for Legal Hierarchies)
